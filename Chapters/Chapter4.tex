\chapter{Project Overview and Objectives}
\label{Chapter4}

The primary objective of this project is to complete the design and physical implementation of the UETRV-Pcore, a RISC-V-based System-on-Chip (SoC), using a structured ASIC flow. The specific objectives are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item End-to-End ASIC Flow Implementation: To implement the UETRV-Pcore from Register Transfer Level (RTL) to a GDSII layout file, covering all key stages of physical design.
    \item Optimization for Timing, Area, and Power: To synthesize the RTL code into a gate-level netlist optimized for timing, area, and power using Cadence Genus.
    \item Physical Layout and Routing: To perform physical design steps including floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, and routing using Cadence Innovus.
    \item Fabrication-Ready GDSII: To generate a verified GDSII layout file that meets design rule checks (DRC) and layout vs. schematic (LVS) checks, making the design ready for fabrication.
    \item Contribute to Open-Source Hardware: To contribute to the global RISC-V and open-source hardware community by creating a fabricatable, open-source processor design.
\end{itemize}
