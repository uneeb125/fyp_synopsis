\label{Chapter2}

The goal of this project is to design a physical chip for the RV P core, a high-performance processor core based on the RISC-V architecture. To achieve this, we aim to convert the RTL (Register Transfer Level) design into a GDS (Graphic Data System) file, which is essential for fabricating the physical chip. However, this process presents several challenges. First, ensuring the accuracy and optimization of the RTL-to-GDS translation is crucial to avoid functional and timing issues. Additionally, managing power consumption, minimizing area, and adhering to fabrication constraints are key considerations. Furthermore, the verification and validation steps are complex, requiring extensive simulation and testing to guarantee the chip's reliability.
